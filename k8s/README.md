# Kubernetes delivery

[`helm/demand-forecast-service/`](helm/demand-forecast-service/) is the **only** Helm chart and source of Kubernetes workload definitions in this repository. It contains Deployment, Service, ServiceAccount, PodDisruptionBudget, HorizontalPodAutoscaler, and NetworkPolicy templates. [`argocd/application.yaml`](argocd/application.yaml) tracks the chart path in this repository.

Before deploying, review `values.yaml` for the image tag, artifact/data mounts, secrets, image pull access, resource sizing, health probes, and termination timing. `autoscaling.enabled` and `networkPolicy.enabled` are off by default; enable them only after the target cluster’s metrics, ingress peers, DNS, and external inference egress are understood. The default NetworkPolicy peer allows pods in the same namespace only. A PDB with `minAvailable: 1` assumes at least two replicas.

```sh
helm lint k8s/helm/demand-forecast-service --strict
helm template demand-forecast-service k8s/helm/demand-forecast-service --namespace demand-forecast-service
helm template demand-forecast-service k8s/helm/demand-forecast-service --namespace demand-forecast-service --set autoscaling.enabled=true --set networkPolicy.enabled=true
```

See [architecture](../docs/architecture.md) and the [operations runbook](../docs/operations.md). The chart is a reference release definition; this repository does not claim a live cluster deployment.
